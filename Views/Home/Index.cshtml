        <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
        <p>
            This site showcases my work as a software engineer, with a focus on building
            real-world applications using modern .NET technologies. On this site you’ll find some interactive demos, 
            a couple of APIs I’ve built, and links to the source code on GitHub.

        <h2>AvikstromPortfolio (WebApp)</h2>
        <p>
            This site itself is built with <strong>.NET 8 MVC.</strong> 
            It’s the main project in my portfolio and shows how I put 
            together a full web application with clean structure, 
            responsive design, and integration to external APIs. 
            The Portfolio section includes demos that highlight real‑time 
            features and external data integrations..

        <h2>FlightInfoApi</h2>
        <p>
            This project is built with <strong>.NET 9 Web API.</strong>
            It connects to AeroDataBox to pull real‑time flight data and 
            makes that information available to the web app. I use it to 
            power the FlightBoard demo, showing how external APIs can be 
            integrated and served through a clean, controller‑based API design.

        <h2>f1_info_api</h2>
        <p>
            This project is built with <strong>Python</strong> and uses FastF1 to 
            fetch Formula 1 race data. It’s a simple API that lets the portfolio 
            site display upcoming races and standings.

        <h2>Deployment</h2>
        <p>
            All of these projects run on <strong>Microsoft Azure</strong>.
            I’ve set up hosting, managed resources, and configured CI/CD pipelines
            so the apps go from code to a live environment in the cloud.
